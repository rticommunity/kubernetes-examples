## Communicaitons Between External Applications and Pods Within a Kubernetes Cluster Using a Gateway

### Problem

Explosing DDS applications outside a Kubernetes cluster introduces complexities due to the internal virtual network. Each pod in a k8s cluster is allocated a virtual IP address, which is inherently inaccessible from outside the cluster. This complicates the direct communication required by external applications aiming to exchange data with applications operating within the cluster.

### Solution

To establish communication between internal and external DDS applications, we employ the **RTI Routing Service (RTI RS)** combined with **Real-time WAN Transport** as a gateway. A NodePort service is configured to expose the RTI Routing Service on a static port at each node's IP address, enabling external applications to interact with applicaitons within the cluster.

#### Required Components:

* **DDS Publisher and Subscriber**: These are example applications that demonstrate the data exchange.
* **Routing Service**: Acts as a gateway within the k8s cluster, forwarding data from the external DDS Publisher to the internal DDS Subscriber.
* **NodePort Service**: Created to expose the Routing Service on each nodeâ€™s IP at a specified static port (e.g., Port 30007 as shown in the example diagram). External participants can access the Routing Service by using the address format NodeIP:NodePort (e.g., NODE2_IP:30007).

### Required Docker Images
- [RTI Routing Service (RS)](../dockerfiles/rti_routingservice)
- [RTI Cloud Discovery Service (CDS)](../dockerfiles/rti_clouddiscoveryservice)
- [RTI DDS Ping Subscriber](../dockerfiles/rti_ddsping_sub)

### Steps

#### 1. Create a ConfigMap for RTI License.
`$ kubectl create configmap rti-license --from-file rti_license.dat`

This command creates a ConfigMap to store the RTI License, required for running RTI CDS and RTI RS in the evaluation package.

#### 2. Create a Deployment and a ClusterIP Service for Cloud Discovery Service.
`$ kubectl create -f rticlouddiscoveryservice.yaml`

This command creates a Deployment and a Service for RTI CDS, which is used for discovery between the internal DDS Subscriber and RTI RS. 

#### 3. Create a ConfigMap for the Routing Service XML configuration file
`$ kubectl create configmap routingservice-rwt --from-file=USER_ROUTING_SERVICE.xml`

This command stores the Routing Service XML configuration file (USER_ROUTING_SERVICE.xml) as a ConfigMap, which can be updated as needed. 

#### 4. Create a NodePort service for Routing Service
`$ kubectl create -f rtiroutingservice_nodeport.yaml `

This step creates a NodePort service for the RTI RS to make the RTI RS accessible from external applications.

#### 4. Create a StatefulSet for Routing Service. 
`$ kubectl get service`

Use this command to determine the node port assigned by Kubernetes.

**(NOTE: Update the values for PUBLIC_IP (with one of IP addresses of nodes) and PUBLIC_PORT (with the assigned node port) as necessary in this file).**

`$ kubectl create -f rtiroutingservice.yaml`

This step creates a StatefulSet and a NodePort service for RTI RS. 

#### 5. Create a Deployment for a RTI DDS Ping subscriber
`$ kubectl create -f rtiddsping_sub.yaml`

This command deploys the internal RTI DDS Ping Subscriber, which uses CDS for discovering the RTI RS within the cluster.

#### 6. Run the external publisher (outside the cluster). 
**(NOTE: Adjust the initial_peer setting (using PUBLIC_IP:PUBLIC_PORT) in rwt_participant.xml).**

`$ rtiddsping -qosFile rwt_participant.xml -qosProfile RWT_Demo::RWT_Profile -publisher -domainId 100`

With these configurations, all necessary components should now be operational within the Kubernetes cluster. Execute the command above to run the external DDS Publisher application.
